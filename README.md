## 🌟 Introduction

Convolutional Neural Networks are powerful deep learning models used for image processing, computer vision, and more. This repository demonstrates:
- Applying zero-padding to input images.
- Performing a single convolution step.
- Conducting forward propagation in a convolutional layer.
- Implementing pooling operations (max and average pooling).

These examples are implemented in Python using `NumPy` and `Matplotlib`, providing a step-by-step guide to the foundational aspects of CNNs. 📊📸

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `h5py`

### Installation
Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CNN-StepByStep.git
cd CNN-StepByStep
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy matplotlib h5py
🔍 Core Concepts
1️⃣ Zero-Padding
Zero-padding adds borders of zeros around input images to preserve spatial dimensions during convolution operations.

2️⃣ Single-Step Convolution
A single convolution step applies a filter (weight matrix) to a slice of the input data, producing an output scalar.

3️⃣ Forward Propagation
This involves applying filters and biases across the input data to produce feature maps for the next layer.

4️⃣ Pooling Layers
Pooling layers downsample feature maps, reducing their size while retaining important information. Supported modes: max pooling and average pooling.

🛠️ How to Use
Run the Python scripts in sequence to execute each step of the CNN operations:

bash
Copy code
python zero_padding.py
python single_step_convolution.py
python conv_forward.py
python pool_forward.py
Explore the visualization outputs for better understanding! 🖼️
