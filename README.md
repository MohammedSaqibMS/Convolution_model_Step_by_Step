# ðŸ§  Convolutional Neural Networks: Step by Step

Welcome to the **Convolutional Neural Networks: Step by Step** repository! ðŸš€ This project provides an in-depth implementation of foundational concepts in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including zero-padding, convolutional steps, forward propagation, and pooling layers. 

This repository is an excellent resource for anyone looking to understand the mechanics of CNNs through practical coding examples. ðŸ’»âœ¨
